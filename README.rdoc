== RAILS TODO LIST API

The point of this repo is to provide people with a simple todo list api. It is perfect for trying to practice backbone or angular and see how it works with rails.

I will be pushing this to a website soon. I will put a link up as soon as it is done.

Thanks! - Corey Ghilarducci
